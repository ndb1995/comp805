<!--
Not sure if this is the proper way to comment our HTML code
however...
These two for loops loop on the dictionaries (as an object?)
and allow us to access the attributes assocaited with that objects
not much difference than declaring a class and associating
attributes with it in a regular language like Java or C++
. -->
